This system improves the [IU (IUBH)](https://www.iu.org/) University Quality Management (QM) capabilities. Students can easily report mistakes in, for example, Scripts of Modules or other materials provided by the University.

Hinthub uses [Symfony 5.3+](https://symfony.com/) and [EasyAdmin 3.x](https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/index.html). Symfony uses [Doctrine 2](https://www.doctrine-project.org/), the [Twig Templating Engine](https://twig.symfony.com/), [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org) and various other packages (upgradeable with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) ). Furthermore [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) being used for the deployments.

Unlimited teas and coffees to the developers of Open Source Software such as [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/de/), [LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org/), [Draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) and last but not least [GNU/Linux and the Debian Project](https://www.debian.org/index.de.html)
